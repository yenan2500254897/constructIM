/// Profiling counters. The purpose of this device is to gauge whether unwanted
/// or non-obvious allocations are taking place for a specific section. This
/// profiler has that very specific purpose and is not a replacement for
/// full-fledged memory profiling. This works by replacing global operator new
/// and delete, not any deeper hooks on malloc() at this time. To operate this
/// device you must first recompile and relink with RB_PROF_ALLOC defined at
/// least for the ircd/allocator.cc unit.
///
/// 1. Create an instance by copying the this_thread variable which will
/// snapshot the current counters.
/// 2. At some later point, create a second instance by copying the
/// this_thread variable again.
/// 3. Use the arithmetic operators to compute the difference between the two
/// snapshots and the result will be the count isolated between them.
