/// Profiling for the context system.
///
/// These facilities provide tools and statistics. The primary purpose here is
/// to alert developers of unwanted context behavior, in addition to optimizing
/// the overall performance of the context system.
///
/// The original use case is for the embedded database backend. Function calls
/// are made which may conduct blocking I/O before returning. This will hang the
/// current userspace context while it is running and thus BLOCK EVERY CONTEXT
/// in the entire IRCd. Since this is still an asynchronous system, it just
/// doesn't have callbacks: we do not do I/O without a cooperative yield.
/// Fortunately there are mechanisms to mitigate this -- but we have to know
/// for sure. A database call which has been passed over for mitigation may
/// start doing some blocking flush under load, etc. The profiler will alert
/// us of this so it doesn't silently degrade performance.
